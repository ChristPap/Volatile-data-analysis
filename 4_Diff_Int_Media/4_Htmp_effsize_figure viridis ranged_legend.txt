[1] "Figure 6. Left: Heatmap of the pareto-scaled intensities ranged between 0 and 1 for each compound that was emitted by Burkholderia AD24 when cultivated in 0.1 TSBA + AA (red, left columns) and 0.1 TSBA (blue, right columns). Middle: Effect size graph of the difference in the intensities of each compound that was produced when Burkholderia AD24 was cultivated in the two different media. Points indicate the p value of the Welch Two Sample t-testperformed for each compound (pink: p < 0.05, green: p > 0.05. Green line represents effect size of -1 standard deviation which is portraying a threshold to strong effect. Left: Annotation and retention time of the compounds emitted by Burkholderia AD24"
