[1] "Heatmap of transformed intensities (square root transformed, pareto scaled and ranged between 0 and 1) of the compounds that were found to be significantly different between inoculated treatments and abiotic controls. Compound names in red indicate that they were found in significantly higher intensities in inoculated media. Left most columns indicate p-value of the pairwise comparisons for each compound in 0.1 TSA (right) and 0.1 TSA + AAmixture (left)."
